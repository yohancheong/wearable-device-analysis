### How the script works
There is one R script in wearable-device-analysis repository, which is called run_analaysis.R This script aims to achieve the following requirements described in the course project.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

If you look at the script then you can easily find out it has been implemented by same order as the requirments, with the number. Please check the comment on the script. The script has been created to add each measurment for mean and standard deviation as variables, for each subject and activity. In addition to the requirements, I added extrac comment to explain about the script. Thanks.
